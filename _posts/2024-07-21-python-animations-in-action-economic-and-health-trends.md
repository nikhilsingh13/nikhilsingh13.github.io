# Python animations: enhancing data visualisations

Ever wondered if money could buy health? Well, it might not buy happiness directly, but it could add a few years to your life! In this post, we're diving into the interesting connection between a nation's wealth and its health.

I am going to use Python animations and World Bank data to show how closely the world's GDP correlates with life expectancy. We might find some interesting patterns!

*`GDP per capita`* & *`Life Expectancy`* are correlated. While preparing these two datasets for the last 20 years (2003 to 2022), I discovered interesting inequalities, diminishing returns, and outliers.

Static charts often miss the small details or fail to share the complete story. Animations can help reveal those nuances.

*Do you know that in 2003, Luxembourg's GDP per capita was 8x India's, and by 2022, it was 12x? Yet, the life expectancy gap narrowed by 1.5 years.*

- **Python Libraries:**  
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive animations.
  - [matplotlib.animation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/animation_api.html) for simple animations.
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data handling.

## Analysis (with code)

Through 20 years of data (2003-2022), three patterns emerged:
1. **Stark inequalities**: The rich-poor health gap persists.
2. **Diminishing returns**: Health gains slow down after certain wealth levels.
3. **Outliers**: Some nations punch above their weight.

You can find the complete Python code ðŸ”— [here](https://github.com/nikhilsingh13/PythonHacks/blob/main/blog-work/python_animations/py-animation-gdp-lifeexp.ipynb).

The notebook includes both `matplotlib` and `plotly` animation code, along with `ipywidgets`. Itâ€™s always tricky generating GIFs using plotly. If you need GIFs for your presentation, stick with simplicity over aesthetics. Iâ€™d advise going for simplicity over aesthetics. `matplotlib` can simply solve it for you. Also, CXOs and stakeholders rarely care about *aesthetics*.
> These animations are supposed to support your story.

**Pro Tip**: *Pro Tip: Presenting to execs?*
- Use matplotlib's simplicity over plotly's flair.
- Prioritise clear motion over fancy transitions.
- Follow the 3-second rule: If it isnâ€™t clear in 3 seconds, simplify.

## Conclusion

While wealth enables health investments, the relationship isn't linear. Two key takeaways:  
1. **Critical threshold**: ~$5k GDP/capita brings biggest health jumps.
2. **Post-$30k plateau:** Beyond this point, additional wealth has diminishing health returns. 

This was just one lens on how data storytelling can surface deeper insights.  
If you're presenting to decision-makers, **show trends that matter, but don't lose them in the glitter**.

More experiments on the way! ðŸš€
