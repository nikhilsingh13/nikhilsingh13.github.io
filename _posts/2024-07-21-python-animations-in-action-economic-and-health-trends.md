# Python animations: enhancing data visualisations.

Ever wondered if money could buy health? Well, it might not buy happiness directly, but it could add a few years to your life! In this post, we're diving into the interesting connection between a nation's wealth and its health. 

I am going to use Python animations and Worldbank data to show how closely the world's GDP correlates with life expectancy. Probably, we'll find some interesting patterns!

Many people are well aware of the fact that *`GDP per capita`* & *`Life Expectancy`* are correlated. 
While preparing, these 2 datasets for last 20 years (2003 to 2022), I found interesting inequalities, diminishing returns and outliers.

Static charts often miss the small details or are unable to share a complete story. Animations are helpful in such contexts.

*Do you know that in 2003, Luxembourg's GDP per capita was 8x India's. By 2022, it was 12x. But their life expectancy gap? It narrowed by 1.5 years.*

## Data & Tools

- **World Bank Datasets:**  
  - [Life Expectancy](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN)  
  - [GDP per Capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)

- *Data manipulation*
- [Life Expectancy](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN)  

- **Python Libraries:**  
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive animations  
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data handling
